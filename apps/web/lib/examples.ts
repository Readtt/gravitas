Full Assignment:
The STARR Story Bank assignment requires students to write at least two detailed STARR stories demonstrating key skills. Each story must clearly address: Situation, Task, Action, Result, and Result. Stories should be concise, professional, and measurable where possible. The submission should reflect a range of skills relevant to career goals. Clarity, professional tone, and variety in the stories will be evaluated.
Student Example Submission:
Story 1: Describes leading a team in a robotics club to complete a project on time. Mentions tasks, actions taken (dividing responsibilities, scheduling meetings), results (finished early, project won first place), and final impact (team members learned skills). Story follows STARR framework clearly.
Story 2: Describes tutoring younger students in math. Mentions Situation (students struggling), Task (help improve their grades), Actions (used tailored exercises), Results (students improved by 10–15%), Final impact (confidence gained).
Grading:
Clarity & STARR Adherence: Strong
Specificity & Impact: Strong
Professional Tone: Strong
Quantity & Variety: Strong
Overall Difficulty Rating: 35/100
Notes: Easy, minimal thinking required, focus mostly on following the STARR framework correctly. Some light writing and formatting required.

Assignment: CSCA67 Homework Assignment #1
Full Assignment:
Questions 1–3 include logical equivalence, tautology/contradiction identification, and deductive reasoning. Students must provide proofs without truth tables for equivalence, identify truth values, and demonstrate validity of arguments with rules of inference and truth tables. Covers multiple logical concepts with repetitive and tricky wording. Requires careful reading, analysis, and correct logical reasoning.
Student Example Submission:
- Q1: Correct proofs for equivalences 1–10, minor wording mistakes in explanation.
- Q2: Correctly identifies tautologies and contradictions, some proofs verbose but accurate.
- Q3: Deductive reasoning arguments A–E mostly correct, some minor errors in truth table setup, generally complete.
Grading:
Clarity & Correctness: Developing
Workload & Time: Hard
Conceptual Difficulty: Hard
Overall Difficulty Rating: 88/100
Notes: Very long, covers many concepts, highly repetitive, tricky wording. High conceptual demand.

Assignment: CSCA08 Assignment 1: Ice Hockey Fantasy Draft
Full Assignment:
Students complete a Python program to manage a fantasy hockey draft. Must implement several functions (get_player_id, get_position, can_select, compute_fantasy_score, etc.) according to the Function Design Recipe. Starter code and constants provided. Requires understanding Python basics (variables, conditionals, strings), but mostly tedious repetitive work filling out functions and testing. No advanced logic beyond course concepts from weeks 1–3.
Student Example Submission:
- All functions implemented correctly, docstrings provided with examples. Minor typos in comments. Checker passes for style and types. Program works as expected with starter files.
Grading:
Coding Style: Strong
Correctness: Strong
Workload & Tediousness: Developing
Conceptual Difficulty: Medium
Overall Difficulty Rating: 64/100
Notes: Medium-length, tedious, uses repetitive concepts. Straightforward if methodical, not conceptually hard.

Assignment: CSC A67 Tutorial 1 — Introduction to Propositional Logic
Full Assignment:
Tutorial exercises / questions posted online before Monday. In tutorial, TA may review material, present solutions, give guidance. Students work independently or with partners. Solutions submitted on Crowdmark by Tuesday 9 a.m. Grading: 0 = no attempt, 1 = attempt with serious flaws, 2 = solid attempt. Exercises include logical connectives (∨, ∧, ¬), analyzing logical forms of statements, translating formulas to English, and deductive arguments.
Grading:
Clarity & Correctness: Strong
Workload & Time: Low
Conceptual Difficulty: Easy
Overall Difficulty Rating: 40/100
Notes: Minimal studying required; concepts are easy; exercises are short and straightforward.

Assignment: CSC A67 Tutorial 2 — Introduction to Propositional Logic (Harder Version)
Full Assignment:
Similar to the previous tutorial, but includes more complex exercises requiring analysis of logical forms, translation of formulas, and reasoning about deductive arguments. Students must carefully interpret statements and reason about validity. Submission is the same: Crowdmark by Tuesday 9 a.m.
Grading:
Clarity & Correctness: Developing
Workload & Time: Medium
Conceptual Difficulty: Moderate
Overall Difficulty Rating: 50/100
Notes: Slightly harder to wrap your head around; requires some studying; not too long.

Assignment: CSC/MAT A67 Tutorial 4 — Quantifiers
Full Assignment:
Focus on quantifiers, negation, and translation between English statements and logical expressions. Exercises include:
- Quantifier basics (truth values of statements like ∀x, P(x) or ∃x, Q(x))
- Translating specifications into English and logical notation
- Negating statements and re-expressing them positively
- Analyzing logical forms of classroom statements
Submission required for some exercises; others are practice.
Grading:
Clarity & Correctness: Developing
Workload & Time: Medium-High
Conceptual Difficulty: Hard
Overall Difficulty Rating: 60/100
Notes: Requires a lot of pre-existing knowledge and careful thinking; content not long, but conceptually dense; exercises require reasoning through multiple logical steps.

QUANTAM COMPUTING ASSIGNMENT
"This assignment covers advanced topics in quantum mechanics including perturbation theory, spin-orbit coupling, and multi-particle systems. Students must solve 10 challenging problems requiring analytical derivations, numerical simulations, and conceptual reasoning. Detailed solutions must include all mathematical steps, assumptions, and justifications. Collaboration is prohibited, and any use of online solutions or AI tools must be cited. Submission must be a PDF with neatly formatted equations and diagrams. Students are expected to spend extensive time on research, reviewing lecture notes, and consulting primary sources from textbooks and journal papers. The assignment is designed to push students’ understanding to the limits, testing problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and mastery of advanced quantum mechanics concepts."
would be a 95+ its way too hard for an university student and it would probably make me cry.

key notes: the amount of time an assignment will take is most likely the determinigng factor of difficulty.`;
